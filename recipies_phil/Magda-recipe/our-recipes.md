>This chickpea curry is the easiest and simplest recipe you can make. It requires easy-to-find ingredients you can get at any supermarket, and it’s so nutritious you could eat it every day!

>>This recipe is delicious just by itself, but I like to eat it with some carbs, like Basmati rice (any other rice will work too), or pita or naan bread. I also like to serve it with more veggies on the side to get a balanced meal.

>>>Besides, you can also customize it with your favorite spices and herbs. I usually add some fresh cilantro or parsley, although any other fresh herb will do. Go ahead and add anything you have on hand!
